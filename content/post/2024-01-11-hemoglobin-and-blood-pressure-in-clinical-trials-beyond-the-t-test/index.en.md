# Introduction

In my last linkedin Post I mentioned about how :

+ Taking a sample from two groups from a population and seeing if there's a significant or substantial difference between them is a standard task in statistics. 
+ Measuring performance on a test before and after some sort of intervention, measuring average GDP in two different continents, measuring average height in two groups of flowers, etc.
+ we like to know if any group differences we see are attributable to chance / measurement error, or if they're real.

## Run a t.test assuming equal variances.


```r
# Assume equal variances
t_test_eq <- t.test(Level_of_Hemoglobin ~ Blood_Pressure_Abnormality, data = data_new, var.equal = TRUE)
t_test_eq
#> 
#> 	Two Sample t-test
#> 
#> data:  Level_of_Hemoglobin by Blood_Pressure_Abnormality
#> t = 6.2965, df = 1998, p-value = 0.0000000003733
#> alternative hypothesis: true difference in means between group Abnormal and group Normal is not equal to 0
#> 95 percent confidence interval:
#>  0.4199599 0.7999081
#> sample estimates:
#> mean in group Abnormal   mean in group Normal 
#>               12.01897               11.40903
```


{{% callout note %}}

The default output is helpfulâ€”the p-value is really tiny *(p<0.001)*, which means there's a tiny chance that we'd see a difference that big in group means in a world where there's no difference

{{% /callout %}}

## but there is some drawbacks with this

{{% callout warning %}}

- there are some assumptions that need to be met for the t.test to work
- some the more general assumptions are **equality of variances* and *normality of data*

{{% /callout %}}

## testing for assumptions

For all these tests, the null hypothesis is that the two groups have similar (homogeneous) variances. If the p-value is less than 0.05, we can assume that they have unequal or heterogeneous variances.

- [**Bartlett test**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bartlett%27s_test): Check homogeneity of variances based on the mean


```r
bartlett.test(Level_of_Hemoglobin ~ Blood_Pressure_Abnormality, data = data_new)
#> 
#> 	Bartlett test of homogeneity of variances
#> 
#> data:  Level_of_Hemoglobin by Blood_Pressure_Abnormality
#> Bartlett's K-squared = 452.93, df = 1, p-value < 0.00000000000000022
```

- [**Levene test**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levene%27s_test): Check homogeneity of variances based on the median, so it's more robust to outliers


```r
    # Install the car package first
car::leveneTest(Level_of_Hemoglobin ~ Blood_Pressure_Abnormality, data = data_new)
#> Levene's Test for Homogeneity of Variance (center = median)
#>         Df F value                Pr(>F)    
#> group    1   540.2 < 0.00000000000000022 ***
#>       1998                                  
#> ---
#> Signif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1
```

- [**Fligner-Killeen test**](https://biostats.w.uib.no/test-for-homogeneity-of-variances-levenes-test/): Check homogeneity of variances based on the median, so it's more robust to outliers


```r
fligner.test(Level_of_Hemoglobin ~ Blood_Pressure_Abnormality, data = data_new)
#> 
#> 	Fligner-Killeen test of homogeneity of variances
#> 
#> data:  Level_of_Hemoglobin by Blood_Pressure_Abnormality
#> Fligner-Killeen:med chi-squared = 415.5, df = 1, p-value <
#> 0.00000000000000022
```

- [**Kruskal-Wallis test**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kruskal%E2%80%93Wallis_one-way_analysis_of_variance): Check homogeneity of distributions nonparametrically


```r
kruskal.test(Level_of_Hemoglobin ~ Blood_Pressure_Abnormality, data = data_new)
#> 
#> 	Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test
#> 
#> data:  Level_of_Hemoglobin by Blood_Pressure_Abnormality
#> Kruskal-Wallis chi-squared = 4.9122, df = 1, p-value = 0.02667
```

## Simulation-based tests

Instead of dealing with all the assumptions of the data and finding the exact statistical test we can use the power of bootstrapping, permutation, and simulation to construct a null distribution and calculate confidence intervals.

{{% callout note %}}

## Step 1

- [x] First we calculate the difference in means in the actual data:

{{% /callout %}}



```r
# Calculate the difference in means
diff_means <- data_new %>% 
  specify(Level_of_Hemoglobin ~ Blood_Pressure_Abnormality) %>%
  calculate("diff in means", order = c("Abnormal", "Normal"))
diff_means
#> Response: Level_of_Hemoglobin (numeric)
#> Explanatory: Blood_Pressure_Abnormality (factor)
#> # A tibble: 1 x 1
#>    stat
#>   <dbl>
#> 1 0.610
```
{{% callout note %}}

## Step 2

- [x] Then we can generate a bootstrapped distribution of the difference in means based on our sample and calculate the confidence interval:

{{% /callout %}}




```r
boot_means <- data_new %>% 
  specify(Level_of_Hemoglobin ~ Blood_Pressure_Abnormality) %>% 
  generate(reps = 1000, type = "bootstrap") %>% 
  calculate("diff in means", order = c("Abnormal", "Normal"))

boostrapped_confint <- boot_means %>% get_confidence_interval()

boot_means %>% 
  visualize() + 
  shade_confidence_interval(boostrapped_confint,
                            color = "#8bc5ed", fill = "#85d9d2") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = diff_means$stat, size = 1, color = "#77002c") +
  labs(title = "Bootstrapped distribution of differences in means",
       x = "Action âˆ’ Comedy", y = "Count",
       subtitle = "Red line shows observed difference; shaded area shows 95% confidence interval") +
  theme_fancy()
```

<img src="staticsim-boot-1.png" width="672" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

{{% callout note %}}

> We have a simulation-based confidence interval, and it doesn't contain zero, so we can have some confidence that there's a real difference between the two groups. 

{{% /callout %}}


{{% callout note %}}

## Step 3

- [x] next we generate a world where there's no difference by shuffling all the Abnormal/Normal labels through permutation

{{% /callout %}}


```r
# Step 2: Invent a world where Î´ is null
genre_diffs_null <- data_new %>% 
  specify(Level_of_Hemoglobin ~ Blood_Pressure_Abnormality) %>%
  hypothesize(null = "independence") %>% 
  generate(reps = 5000, type = "permute") %>% 
   calculate("diff in means", order = c("Abnormal", "Normal"))

# Step 3: Put actual observed Î´ in the null world and see if it fits
genre_diffs_null %>% 
  visualize() + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = diff_means$stat, size = 1, color = "#77002c") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = comma) +
  labs(x = "Simulated difference in average ratings (Abnormal âˆ’ Normal)", 
       y = "Count",
       title = "Simulation-based null distribution of differences in means",
       subtitle = "Red line shows observed difference") +
  theme_fancy()
```

<img src="staticsim-generate-null-world-1.png" width="672" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

That red line is pretty far to the left and seems like it wouldn't fit very well in a world where there's no actual difference between the groups. We can calculate the probability of seeing that red line in a null world (step 4) with `get_p_value()` (and we can use the cool new `pvalue()` function in the **scales** library to format it as < 0.001):


{{% callout note %}}

## Step 4

- [x] Calculate probability that observed Î´ could exist in

{{% /callout %}}


```r
# Step 4: Calculate probability that observed Î´ could exist in null world
genre_diffs_null %>% 
  get_p_value(obs_stat = diff_means, direction = "both") %>% 
  mutate(p_value_clean = pvalue(p_value))
#> # A tibble: 1 x 2
#>   p_value p_value_clean
#>     <dbl> <chr>        
#> 1       0 <0.001
```

{{% callout note %}}

## Conclusion

- [x] Because the p-value is so small, it passes pretty much all evidentiary thresholds (p < 0.05, p < 0.01, etc), so we can safely say that there's a difference between the two groups.
