Today, we'll be covering the most useful SQL commands — let's start with them one by one. This includes the following:\n\n* `SELECT`: returns either all columns using * or specific columns as specified, seperated by a comma. \n* `FROM` : specifies the table that the data should be returned from. \n* `LIMIT`: limits the number of rows returned.\n* `AS`: lets you set an alias for a particular column \n* `ORDER BY`: returns the data sorted by column specified. Can be sorted in `ASC` (ascending) or `DESC` (descending). \n* `WHERE`: lets you filter on a specific column or value\n* `GROUP BY`: lets you aggregate on one or more columns \n* `MAX()`: returns the maximum amount of a particular column \n* `AVG()`: returns the total average of a particular column \n\n### Code Commenting\nThere are two types of code commenting in Postgres\n\n-- `Inline commenting` : Used for quick, short notes \n\n\"/*\" `Multi line commenting` \"*/\" (use without quotation marks): Used for longer comments, such as metadata, or code headers including the author, date, purpose, etc.  \n","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"5a74b7b5-b09c-4d0a-a78b-30530683e51d"},{"source":"-- SELECT the first 10 rows of all the columns from the airbnb dataset\nSELECT *\nFROM 'airbnb_data.csv' \nLIMIT 10 ","metadata":{"customType":"sql","dataFrameVariableName":"df","sqlCellMode":"dataFrame","sqlSource":{"type":"dataframesAndCsvs"},"executionCancelledAt":null,"executionTime":162,"lastExecutedAt":1695133770046,"lastScheduledRunId":null,"lastSuccessfullyExecutedCode":"-- SELECT the first 10 rows of all the columns from the airbnb dataset\nSELECT *\nFROM 'airbnb_data.csv' \nLIMIT 10 ","outputsMetadata":{"0":{"height":315,"type":"dataFrame"}}},"cell_type":"code","id":"6f6d8291-0943-4322-9f9e-145b67d075fd","execution_count":3,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"application/com.datacamp.data-table.v1+json":{"table":{"schema":{"fields":[{"name":"index","type":"integer"},{"name":"listing_id","type":"integer"},{"name":"description","type":"string"},{"name":"host_id","type":"number"},{"name":"neighbourhood_full","type":"string"},{"name":"coordinates","type":"string"},{"name":"room_type","type":"string"},{"name":"price","type":"number"},{"name":"number_of_reviews","type":"integer"},{"name":"reviews_per_month","type":"number"},{"name":"availability_365","type":"integer"},{"name":"rating","type":"number"},{"name":"number_of_stays","type":"number"},{"name":"listing_added","type":"datetime","tz":"UTC"}],"primaryKey":["index"],"pandas_version":"1.4.0"},"data":[{"index":0,"listing_id":13740704,"description":"Cozy,budget friendly, cable inc, private entrance!","host_id":20583125,"neighbourhood_full":"Brooklyn, Flatlands","coordinates":"(40.63222, -73.93398)","room_type":"Private Room","price":45,"number_of_reviews":10,"reviews_per_month":0.7,"availability_365":85,"rating":4.1009535687,"number_of_stays":12,"listing_added":"2018-06-08T00:00:00.000Z"},{"index":1,"listing_id":22005115,"description":"Two floor apartment near Central Park","host_id":82746113,"neighbourhood_full":"Manhattan, Upper West Side","coordinates":"(40.78761, -73.96862)","room_type":"Entire place","price":135,"number_of_reviews":1,"reviews_per_month":1,"availability_365":145,"rating":3.3675998415,"number_of_stays":1.2,"listing_added":"2018-12-25T00:00:00.000Z"},{"index":2,"listing_id":6425850,"description":"Spacious, charming studio","host_id":32715865,"neighbourhood_full":"Manhattan, Upper West Side","coordinates":"(40.79169, -73.97498)","room_type":"Entire place","price":86,"number_of_reviews":5,"reviews_per_month":0.13,"availability_365":0,"rating":4.7632029943,"number_of_stays":6,"listing_added":"2017-03-20T00:00:00.000Z"},{"index":3,"listing_id":22986519,"description":"Bedroom on the lively Lower East Side","host_id":154262349,"neighbourhood_full":"Manhattan, Lower East Side","coordinates":"(40.71884, -73.98354)","room_type":"Private Room","price":160,"number_of_reviews":23,"reviews_per_month":2.29,"availability_365":102,"rating":3.822590628,"number_of_stays":27.6,"listing_added":"2020-10-23T00:00:00.000Z"},{"index":4,"listing_id":271954,"description":"Beautiful brownstone apartment","host_id":1423798,"neighbourhood_full":"Manhattan, Greenwich Village","coordinates":"(40.73388, -73.99452)","room_type":"Entire place","price":150,"number_of_reviews":203,"reviews_per_month":2.22,"availability_365":300,"rating":4.4783964853,"number_of_stays":243.6,"listing_added":"2018-12-15T00:00:00.000Z"},{"index":5,"listing_id":14218742,"description":"Luxury/3bedroom/3bthrm/Privateprkng/beach/rstrnts","host_id":78824908,"neighbourhood_full":"Brooklyn, Sheepshead Bay","coordinates":"(40.58531, -73.93811)","room_type":"Entire place","price":224,"number_of_reviews":2,"reviews_per_month":0.08,"availability_365":353,"rating":4.0912284076,"number_of_stays":2.4,"listing_added":"2017-12-17T00:00:00.000Z"},{"index":6,"listing_id":15125599,"description":"Beautiful One Bedroom Apartment Near Central Park","host_id":3191545,"neighbourhood_full":"Manhattan, Theater District","coordinates":"(40.761, -73.98522)","room_type":"Entire place","price":169,"number_of_reviews":5,"reviews_per_month":0.15,"availability_365":365,"rating":3.5629466795,"number_of_stays":6,"listing_added":"2016-12-20T00:00:00.000Z"},{"index":7,"listing_id":24553891,"description":"Enjoy all of Manhattan.
